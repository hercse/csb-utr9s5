In order to keep up with the trend, I chose the most basic color scheme of gray, black and white.

Using the Google Sheet API makes it more convenient for us to modify and manage our articles anywhere, although it is convenient.  , but there are also inconveniences. For example, reading express is a big disadvantage. Because of the relationship of the public API, the Google API server does not allocate too many data resources to Google Sheet, which makes reading a few more seconds.  , resulting in a user experience that does not deduct points, but is not refreshing.  I hope to solve this problem through other technologies and storage methods in the future.
